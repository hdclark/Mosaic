 ================

    This program is a simplistic OpenGL-based flashcard viewer that implements a modified version of
the SuperMemo algorithm (v2). It is vaguely similar to Anki, but is completely local. A (local) 
sqlite database is used to persist user information (required for the algorithm).

    Flashcards can contain images, including animated gifs, and are re-flowed to a comfortable line 
length, but are otherwise displayed as-is. Flashcards are supplied as arguments to the executable,
so sub-sets are naturally possible. What consitutes a 'session' (important for the algoithm) is a 
little bit fuzzy, so a grace time of prior to when the last session began is used to demarcate the
most recent session. Currently sessions do not honour flashcard sub-sets, but you can swap out the
database to accomplish more fine-grained behaviour if desired.
